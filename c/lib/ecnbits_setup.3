.Dt ECNBITS_SETUP 3
.Os ECN-Bits
.Sh NAME
.Nm ecnbits_setup
.Nd set up a socket for use with the ECN-Bits library
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In ecn\-bits.h
.Ft int
.Fn ecnbits_setup "int socketfd" "int af" "unsigned char iptos" "const char **errstring"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn ecnbits_setup
function sets up a network socket (IPv6 or legacy IPv4)
for use by the ECN-Bits library.
This works well with datagram sockets (UDP); use with stream sockets
(TCP) may not work completely, for example the operating system may
change the sent traffic class value.
.Pp
The
.Ar socketfd
itself is not changed, but a few socket options are enabled.
For this to work, the
.Ar af
argument is expected to carry the address family used with the socket
.Pq Li AF_INET6 No or Li AF_INET ;
this is the same as the first argument to
.Xr socket 2
.Pq Li domain .
This function is thread-safe.
.Pp
The
.Ar iptos
value is expected to contain the traffic class octet intended to be
sent out with this socket; this can be one of the ECN values...
.Bd -literal
#define ECNBITS_NON	0 /* non-ECN-capable transport */
#define ECNBITS_ECT0	2 /* ECN-capable; L4S: legacy transport */
#define ECNBITS_ECT1	1 /* ECN-capable; L4S: L4S-aware transport */
#define ECNBITS_CE	3 /* congestion experienced */
.Ed
.Pp
\&... possibly or'd with a system-provided value such as
.Dv IPTOS_LOWDELAY ,
a DSCP and/or class value or really anything appropriate.
The operating system defaults usually to either
.Li 0 Pq Li ECNBITS_NON
or
.Li 2 Pq Li ECNBITS_ECT0 .
Note that ISPs can change the traffic class of packets they transmit.
.Pp
The
.Ar errstring
argument, if it is not
.Dv NULL ,
is set to a human-readable description of the problem on failure
.Pq even if ignored ,
which can be output in addition to whatever value
.Va errno
was set by the system calls used internally, and to
.Dv NULL
on success.
.Pp
Note that the
.Ar iptos
value is only used to set the default outgoing traffic class.
It can still be overridden by using
.Xr sendmsg 2
with a
.Xr cmsg 3
control message of
.Dv IPV6_TCLASS
.Pq Dv IPPROTO_IPV6
or
.Dv IP_TOS
.Pq Dv IPPROTO_IP ;
the ECN-Bits c/server example demonstrates this technique.
It is not strictly necessary for using the ECN-Bits library's
receive functions to set this value, but it is provided for
convenience, as almost any application using ECN-Bits will wish
to set them (applications can later change the setting with
.Xr setsockopt 2
anyway).
On Windows\(rg or WSL platforms, failure to set the traffic class
for sent packets is silently ignored, although the
.Ar errstring
is still set.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std ecnbits_setup
The
.Ar errstring
value is additionally set
.Pq see above .
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code fragment illustrates the usage:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int fd;
const char *errstr;

if ((fd = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)) == \-1)
	err(1, "socket");
/* do other setsockopt, if needed */
if (ecnbits_setup(fd, AF_INET6, ECNBITS_ECT0, &errstr))
	err(1, "ecnbits_setup: %s", errstr);
/* connect, bind, etc. */
.Ed
.Sh ERRORS
Besides the errors returned by the system calls
.Nm
uses internally (currently, only
.Xr setsockopt 2 ,
but this is implementation detail subject to change without notice),
.Dv EAFNOSUPPORT
is returned if
.Ar af
.Pq the address family
is not known to the library.

.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation uses socket calls documented in the MidnightBSD manual page
.Xr ip6 4
.Pq standardised by RFC\ 3542
for IPv6, those documented by the MidnightBSD
.Xr ip 4
or GNU/Linux
.Xr ip 7
manual pages for legacy IPv4.
.Pp
The socket options for receiving the IP traffic class are also supported
on Windows\(rg environments, although setting it on outgoing packets isn't.
