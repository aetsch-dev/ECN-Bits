The Android skeleton was autogenerated by IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1 (most
of which trivial enough to lack copyright). OutputListAdapter is the
“obvious” minimal implementation for a RecyclerView adapter and thus
also in the Public Domain. The Gradle wrapper included in the skele‐
ton is licenced separately, see below. At build time extra libraries
will be downloaded and used, some included in the APK; refer to each
individually for copyright notes and licence terms. Everything else,
also as a collective-work licence, is published under the MirBSD li‐
cence reproduced at the top of this file.

Gradle wrapper 5.6.4 © 2007–2014, 2015, 2017 and published under the
terms of the Apache 2 licence; see android/client/gradle* for speci‐
fics including the full text of the licence.
